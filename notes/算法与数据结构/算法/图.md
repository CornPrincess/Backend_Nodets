> A *graph* is a set of *vertices* and a collection of *edges* that each connect a pair of vertices. We use the names 0 through V-1 for the vertices in a V-vertex graph.

> 图是由一组顶点和一组能够将两个顶点项链的边组成的

>  Here are some definitions that we use.
>
> - A *self-loop* （自环） is an edge that connects a vertex to itself.
> - Two edges are *parallel* （平行边）if they connect the same pair of vertices.
> - When an edge connects two vertices, we say that the vertices are *adjacent to* （相邻）one another and that the edge is *incident on*（依附于） both vertices.
> - The *degree* of （度数）a vertex is the number of edges incident on it.
> - A *subgraph*（子图） is a subset of a graph's edges (and associated vertices) that constitutes a graph.
> - A *path* （路径）in a graph is a sequence of vertices connected by edges, with no repeated edges.
> - A *simple path* （简单路径）is a path with no repeated vertices.
> - A *cycle*（环） is a path (with at least one edge) whose first and last vertices are the same.
> - A *simple cycle*（简单环） is a cycle with no repeated vertices (other than the requisite repetition of the first and last vertices).
> - The *length* （长度）of a path or a cycle is its number of edges（边数）.
> - We say that one vertex is *connected to*（连通） another if there exists a path that contains both of them.
> - A graph is *connected* （连通图）if there is a path from every vertex to every other vertex.
> - A graph that is not connected （非连通图）consists of a set of *connected components*, which are maximal connected subgraphs（极大连通子图）.
> - An *acyclic graph* （无环图）is a graph with no cycles.
> - A *tree* is an acyclic connected graph.（树是无环连通图）
> - A *forest* is a disjoint set of trees.（互不相连的树组成的集合称为森林）
> - A *spanning tree*（生成树） of a connected graph （连通图）is a subgraph that contains all of that graph's vertices and is a single tree. A *spanning forest* （生成树森林）of a graph is the union of the spanning trees of its connected components.
> - A *bipartite graph* （二分图）is a graph whose vertices we can divide into two sets such that all edges connect a vertex in one set with a vertex in the other set.

直观上来说，如果顶点是物理存在的对象，例如绳结或佛珠，而边也是物理存在的对象，例如绳子或电线，**那么将任意顶点提起，连通图都将是一个整体，而非连通图则会变成两个或多个部分。一般来说，要处理一张图就需要一个个处理它的连通分量（子图）。**

当且仅当一幅含有 V 个结点的图 G 满足下列5个添加之一时，它就是一棵树：

- G 有 V-1 条边且不含有环
- G 有 V-1 条边且是连通的
- G 是连通的，但删除任意一条边都会使它不连通
- G 是无环图，但添加任意一条边都会产生一条环
- G 中的任意一对顶点之间仅存在一条简单路径
