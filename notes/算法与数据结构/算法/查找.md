## 符号表 Symbol Tables

**Symbol table.**  The primary purpose of a *symbol table* is to associate a *value* with a *key*. The client can *insert* key–value pairs into the symbol table with the expectation of later being able to *search* for the value associated with a given key.

> **Definition.** A*symboltable*isadatastructureforkey-valuepairsthatsupportstwo operations: *insert* (put) a new pair into the table and *search* for (get) the value as- sociated with a given key.

符号表最主要的目的是将一个键和一个值联系起来，不光可以进行高效地**插入和查找**，还能进行其他的操作.典型符号表的应用

### API

**具体实现的注意点**：见 Reference

### 有序符号表 Ordered Symbol Tables

> In typical applications, keys are `Comparable` objects, so the option exists of using the code `a.compareTo(b)` to compare two keys `a` and `b`. Several symbol-table implementations take advantage of order among the keys that is implied by `Comparable` to provide efficient implementations of the `put()` and `get()` operations. More important, in such implementations, we can think of the symbol table as keeping the keys in order and consider a significantly expanded API that defines numerous natural and useful operations involving relative key order. For applications where keys are `Comparable`, we implement the following API:

- [ ] 补图

**API注意点**：见 Reference

**查找成本模型**：在学习符号表的实现时，我们会统计**比较的次数**（等价性测试或是键的相互比较）。在内循环不进行比较（极少）的情况下，我们会统计**数组的访问次数**。

**Sample clients.**  We consider two clients: a test client that we use to trace algorithm behavior on small inputs and a performance client.

- ***Test client.*** The `main()` client in each of our symbol table implementations reads in a sequence of strings from standard input, builds a symbol table by associating the value i with the ith key in the input, and then prints the table.

- ***Frequency counter.*** Program [FrequencyCounter.java](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/31elementary/FrequencyCounter.java.html) is a symbol-table client that finds the number of occurrences of each string (having at least as many characters as a given threshold length) in a sequence of strings from standard input, then iterates through the keys to find the one that occurs the most frequently.

`FrequencyCounter` 是一种常见的应用的代表，它的这些特性也是其他符号表应用的特性：

- 混合使用查找和插入的操作
- 大量的不同键
- 查找操作比插入操作多得多
- 虽然不可预测，但查找和插入操作的使用模式并非随机

### 无序列表中的顺序查找 Sequential search in an unordered linked list

**Sequential search in an unordered linked list.** Program [SequentialSearchST.java](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/31elementary/SequentialSearchST.java.html) implements a symbol table with a linked list of nodes that contain keys and values. To implement `get()`, we scan through the list, using `equals()` to compare the search key with the key in each node in the list. If we find the match, we return the associated value; if not, we return `null`. To implement `put()`, we also scan through the list, using `equals()` to compare the client key with the key in each node in the list. If we find the match, we update the value associated with that key to be the value given in the second argument; if not, we create a new node with the given key and value and insert it at the beginning of the list. This method is known as *sequential search*.

![linkedlist ST](https://blog-1300663127.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/BackEnd_Notes/JavaSE/linkedlistST.png)

上述通过链表实现的符号表 get 和 put 操作都要通过遍历链表来实现，这种为**顺序搜索（sequential search）。**使用 equals 方法来比较 key 是否相同。

分析符号表性能是，为了方便我们用命中（search hit）来表示一次成功的查找，未命中（search miss）来表示一次失败的查找。

**Proposition A.** Unsuccessful search and insert in an **(unordered) linked-list symbol table** both use N compares, and successful search uses N compares in the worst case. **In particular, inserting N keys into an initially empty linked-list symbol table uses ~N^2/2 compares.**

> We refer to such a search as a ***random search hit***. Though client search patterns are not likely to be random, they often are well-described by this model. It is easy to show that the average number of compares for a random search hit is ~ *N*/2: the get() method in Algo- rithm 3.1 uses 1 compare to find the first key, 2 compares to find the second key, and so forth, for an average cost of (1 + 2 + ... + *N* )/ *N* = (*N* + 1)/2 ~ *N*/2.

随机命中所需要的平均比较次数为 ～N/2，我们可以得知基于链表的实现以及顺序查找是非常低效的。

### 有序数组中的二分查找 Binary search in an ordered array

**Binary search in an ordered array**. Program [BinarySearchST.java](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/31elementary/BinarySearchST.java.html) implements the ordered symbol table API. The underlying data structure is two parallel array, with the keys kept in order. The heart of the implementation is the `rank()` method, which returns the number of keys smaller than a given key. For `get()`, the rank tells us precisely where the key is to be found if it is in the table (and, if it is not there, that it is not in the table). For `put()`, the rank tells us precisely where to update the value when the key is in the table, and precisely where to put the key when the key is not in the table. We move all larger keys over one position to make room (working from back to front) and insert the given key and value into the proper positions in their respective arrays.

 该实现的核心为rank算法，有递归和非递归两个版本

```java
public int rank(Key key) {
  if (key == null) throw new IllegalArgumentException("argument to rank() is null");

  int lo = 0;
  int hi = n - 1;
  while (lo <= hi) {
    int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;
    int cmp = key.compareTo(keys[mid]);
    if (cmp < 0) hi = mid - 1;
    else if (cmp > 0) lo = mid + 1;
    else return mid;
  }
  return lo;
}

public int rank(Key key, int lo, int hi) {
  if (key == null) throw new IllegalArgumentException("argument to rank() is null");
  if (lo > hi) return lo;
  int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;
  int cmp = key.compareTo(keys[mid]);
  if (cmp < 0) 
    return rank(key, lo, mid - 1);
  else if (cmp > 0) 
    return rank(key, mid + 1, hi);
  else 
    return mid;
}
```

rank() 保留了一下性质：

- 如果表中存在该键，rank 返回该键的位置，也就是表中小于它的键的数量
- 如果表中不存在该键，rank 还是应该返回表中小于它的键的数量

**非递归版本中循环在结束时 lo 的值正好等于表中小于被查找的键的数量。**

**Proposition B.** Binary search in an ordered array with N keys uses **no more than lg N + 1 compares** for a search (successful or unsuccessful) in the worst case.

**Proposition C.** Inserting a new key into an ordered array uses ~ 2N array accesses in the worst case, so **inserting N keys into an initially empty table uses ~ N^2 array accesses in the worst case.**

**二分查找减少了比较的次数，但是无法减少运行时间：因为它无法改变以下事实：在键是随机排列的情况下，构造一个基于有序数组的符号表所需访问数组的次数是数组长度的平方级别。**

#### 简单符号表实现的成本总结

![simple symbol table](https://blog-1300663127.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/BackEnd_Notes/JavaSE/simpleST.png)

**目前的核心问题在于我们能否同时保证查找和插入操作都是对数级别的算法和数据结构。要支持高效的插入操作，我们需要一种链式结构，但是单链接的链表是无法使用二分查找法的，因为二分查找的高效来自于能够快速通过索引取得任何子数组的中间元素（但得到一条链表的中间元素的唯一方法只能是沿链表遍历）。为了将二分查找的效率和链表的灵活性结合起来，我们需要更加复杂的数据结构，即二插查找树BFS。**

## 二叉查找树 Binary Search Trees

二叉查找树是一种能够将**链表插入的灵活性**和**有序数组查找的高效性**结合起来的符号表实现。

首先，我们定义一些术语：

> To begin, we define basic terminology. We are working with data structures made up of ***nodes*** that contain ***links*** that are either ***null*** or **references to other nodes**. In a ***binary tree***, we have the restriction that every node is pointed to by just one other node, which is called its ***parent*** (except for one node, **the *root*, which has no nodes pointing to it**), and that each node has exactly two links, which are called its ***left* and *right* links**, that point to nodes called its ***left child* and *right child***, respectively. Although links point to nodes, we can view each link as pointing to a binary tree, the tree whose root is the referenced node. Thus, we can **define a binary tree as either a null link or a node with a left link and a right link**, each references to (disjoint) *subtrees* that are themselves binary trees. **In a *binary search tree*, each node also has a key and a value, with an ordering restriction to support efficient search.**

我们所使用的数据结构由结点(nodes)组成，结点包含的链接(links)可以为空 null，或者指向其他结点。

**Definition.** A ***binary search tree* (BST)** is a binary tree where each node has a **Comparable key** (and an associated value) and satisfies the restriction that the **key in any node is larger than the keys in all nodes in that node’s left subtree and smaller than the keys in all nodes in that node’s right subtree.**

**二叉查找树每个结点的键都大于其左子树中的任意结点的键而小于右子树的任意节点的键。**
