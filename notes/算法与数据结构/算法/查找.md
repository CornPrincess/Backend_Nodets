## 符号表 Symbol Tables

**Symbol table.**  The primary purpose of a *symbol table* is to associate a *value* with a *key*. The client can *insert* key–value pairs into the symbol table with the expectation of later being able to *search* for the value associated with a given key.

符号表最主要的目的是将一个键和一个值联系起来，不光可以进行高效地**插入和查找**，还能进行其他的操作.典型符号表的应用

## 有序符号表 Ordered Symbol Tables

> In typical applications, keys are `Comparable` objects, so the option exists of using the code `a.compareTo(b)` to compare two keys `a` and `b`. Several symbol-table implementations take advantage of order among the keys that is implied by `Comparable` to provide efficient implementations of the `put()` and `get()` operations. More important, in such implementations, we can think of the symbol table as keeping the keys in order and consider a significantly expanded API that defines numerous natural and useful operations involving relative key order. For applications where keys are `Comparable`, we implement the following API:

**查找成本模型**：在学习符号表的实现时，我们会统计**比较的次数**（等价性测试或是键的相互比较）。在内循环不进行比较（极少）的情况下，我们会统计**数组的访问次数**。

**Sample clients.**  We consider two clients: a test client that we use to trace algorithm behavior on small inputs and a performance client.

- ***Test client.*** The `main()` client in each of our symbol table implementations reads in a sequence of strings from standard input, builds a symbol table by associating the value i with the ith key in the input, and then prints the table.

- ***Frequency counter.*** Program [FrequencyCounter.java](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/31elementary/FrequencyCounter.java.html) is a symbol-table client that finds the number of occurrences of each string (having at least as many characters as a given threshold length) in a sequence of strings from standard input, then iterates through the keys to find the one that occurs the most frequently.

`FrequencyCounter` 是一种常见的应用的代表，它的这些特性也是其他符号表应用的特性：

- 混合使用查找和插入的操作
- 大量的不同键
- 查找操作比插入操作多得多
- 虽然不可预测，但查找和插入操作的使用模式并非随机
