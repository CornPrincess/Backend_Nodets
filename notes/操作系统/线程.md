# 线程

> In traditional operating systems, each process has an address space and a single thread of control. In fact, that is almost the definition of a process. Nevertheless, in many situations, it is desirable to have multiple threads of control in the same address space running in quasi-parallel, as though they were (almost) separate processes (except for the shared address space). In the following sections we will

在传统操作系统中，每一个进程有一个地址空间和一个控制线程（control thread），事实上，这几乎就是进程的定义，不过，经常存在在同一个地址空间中准并行运行多个控制线程的情形，这些线程就像（差不多）分离的进程（共享地址空间除外）。

## 线程的使用

首先说明下需要线程的原因：

- 人们需要多线程的主要原因是，在许多应用中同时发生着多种活动。其中某些活动会随着时间的推移而被阻塞。通过将这些应用分解为可以准并行运行的多个顺序线程，程序设计模型会变得更简单。

  只有在有了多线程概念之后，我们才加入一个新的元素：并行实体共享同一个地址空间和所有可用数据的能力（the ability for the parallel entities to share an address space and all of its data among themselves. ），这正是多进程模型无法提供的（进程有不同的地址空间）。

- > A second argument for having threads is that since they are lighter weight than processes, they are easier (i.e., faster) to create and destroy than processes. In many systems, creating a thread goes 10–100 times faster than creating a process. When the number of threads needed changes dynamically and rapidly, this property is useful to have
