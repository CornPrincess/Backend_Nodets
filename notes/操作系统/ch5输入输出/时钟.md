# 时钟

时钟（clock）又称为定时器（timer）。时钟负责维护时间，并且防止一个进程垄断CPU，此外还有其他的功能。时钟软件可以采用设备驱动程序的形式，时钟不是块设备也不是字符设备。

## 时钟硬件 Clock Hardware

在计算机里通常使用两种类型的时钟，其中一种链接在110v或者220v的电源线上，这样每个电压周期产生一个中断，频率时50Hz或者60Hz，现在几乎已经不用。

另一类时钟由三个部件组成：晶体振荡器（crystal oscillator）、计数器（counter）和存储寄存器（holding register）

在任何计算机中可以找到这样的电路：它给计算机的各种电路提供同步信号。该信号被送到计数器，使其递减技术至0.当计数器变为0时，产生一个CPU中断。

> Programmable clocks typically have several modes of operation. In **one-shot mode**, when the clock is started, it copies the value of the holding register into the counter and then decrements the counter at each pulse from the crystal. When the counter gets to zero, it causes an interrupt and stops until it is explicitly started again by the software. In **square-wave mode**, after getting to zero and causing the interrupt, the holding register is automatically copied into the counter, and the whole process is repeated again indefinitely. These periodic interrupts are called **clock ticks**.

> The advantage of the programmable clock is that its interrupt frequency can be controlled by software. If a 500-MHz crystal is used, then the counter is pulsed every 2 nsec. With (unsigned) 32-bit registers, interrupts can be programmed to oc- cur at intervals from 2 nsec to 8.6 sec. Programmable clock chips usually contain two or three independently programmable clocks and have many other options as well (e.g., counting up instead of down, interrupts disabled, and more).

> To prevent the current time from being lost when the computer’s power is turned off, most computers have a battery-powered backup clock, implemented with the kind of low-power circuitry used in digital watches. The battery clock can be read at startup. If the backup clock is not present, the software may ask the user for the current date and time. There is also a standard way for a networked system to get the current time from a remote host. In any case the time is then translated into the number of clock ticks since 12 A.M. **UTC** (**Universal Coordinated Time**) (formerly known as Greenwich Mean Time) on Jan. 1, 1970, as UNIX does, or since some other benchmark moment. The origin of time for Windows is Jan. 1, 1980. At every clock tick, the real time is incremented by one count. Usually util- ity programs are provided to manually set the system clock and the backup clock and to synchronize the two clocks.

## 时钟软件 Clock Software

时钟硬件所做的全部工作时根据已知的时间间隔产生中断。设计时间的其他所有工作都必须由软件——时钟驱动程序完成。时钟驱动程序的确切任务因操作系统而异，通常包括一下：

- 维护日时间
- 防止进程超时运行

- 对CPU的使用情况记账
- 处理用户进程提出的alarm系统调用
- 为系统本身的各个部分提供监视定时器
- 完成概要剖析、监视和统计信息收集

**每当启动一个进程时，调度程序就讲一个计数器初始化位以时钟抵达位大卫的该记你吃时间片的取值。每次时钟中断时，时钟驱动程序将时间计数器减1.当计数器变为0时，时钟驱动个程序调用调度程序以激活另一个进程。**

> Parts of the operating system also need to set timers. These are called **watch- dog timers（监视定时器）** and are frequently used (especially in embedded devices) to detect problems such as hangs. For instance, a watchdog timer may reset a system that stops running. While the system is running, it regularly resets the timer, so that it never expires. In that case, expiration of the timer proves that the system has not run for a long time, and leads to corrective action—such as a full-system reset.
>
> The mechanism used by the clock driver to handle watchdog timers is the same as for user signals. The only difference is that when a timer goes off, instead of causing a signal, the clock driver calls a procedure supplied by the caller. The pro- cedure is part of the caller’s code. The called procedure can do whatever is neces- sary, even causing an interrupt, although within the kernel interrupts are often inconvenient and signals do not exist. That is why the watchdog mechanism is pro- vided. It is worth nothing that the watchdog mechanism works only when the clock driver and the procedure to be called are in the same address space.

> The last thing in our list is **profiling剖析**. Some operating systems provide a mech- anism by which a user program can have the system build up a histogram of its program counter, so it can see where it is spending its time. When profiling is a possibility, at every tick the driver checks to see if the current process is being pro- filed, and if so, computes the bin number (a range of addresses) corresponding to the current program counter. It then increments that bin by one. This mechanism can also be used to profile the system itself.

## 软定时器 Soft Timers

一般而言，有两种方法管理I/O：中断和轮询（polling），中断具有较低的响应时间。（latency）。也就是说，中断在事件本身之后立即发生，具有很少的延迟（delay）和或者没有延迟。另一方面，对于现代CPU而言，由于需要上下文切换以及对于流水线，TLB和高速缓存，中断具有很大的开销。

替换中断的是让应用程序 对它本身期待的时间进行了轮询，这样避免了中断买单时可能存在相当长的等待时间，因为已加你事情可能正好发生在一次轮询之后，在这种情况下它就要等待几乎整个轮询的间隔。平均而言，等待时间是轮询间隔的一半。

对于某些应用而言，中断的开销和轮询的等待时间都是不能接受的。如高性能的网络。

**软定时器（soft timer）**避免了中断，无论何时当内核因素因某种其他原因在运行时，在它返回到用户态之前，它都要检查实时时钟以了解软定时器是否到期。如果这个定时器已经到期，则执行被调度的时间，而无需切换到内核态，因为系统已经在内核态，在完成工作之后，软定时器被复位以便再次闹醒。
