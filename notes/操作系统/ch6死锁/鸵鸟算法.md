# 鸵鸟算法

最简单的算法是鸵鸟算法：把头埋在沙子里，假装根本没有问题发生。

> People react to this strategy in different ways. Mathematicians find it unacceptable and say that deadlocks must be prevented at all costs. Engineers ask how often the problem is expected, how often the system crashes for other reasons, and how serious a deadlock is. If deadlocks occur on the average once every fiv e years, but system crashes due to hardware failures and operating system bugs occur once a week, most engineers would not be willing to pay a large penalty in performance or convenience to eliminate deadlocks

因为解决死锁问题的代价很高，因此鸵鸟策略这种不采取任务措施的方案会获得更高的性能。

当发生死锁时不会对用户造成多大影响，或发生死锁的概率很低，可以采用鸵鸟策略。

大多数操作系统，包括 Unix，Linux 和 Windows，处理死锁问题的办法仅仅是忽略它。
