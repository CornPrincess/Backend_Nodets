# Relational Model

## Basic Elements

- **Key (candidata)**: **an attribute** or **a combination of attributes** that **uniquely identifies each row** in a relation.
- **Primary key**: the candidate key that is chosen as the **principal means** of identifying entity instances.
- **Foreign  key**: **an attribute** or **a combination of attributes** in a relation that serves as the primary key of another relation.(**An attribute can be both a foreign key and. also part of the primary key.**)
- **Integrity Rule/Constraint**
  - **Entity Integrity Rule/Constraint**: To ensure every relation **has a primary key(UNIQUE)** and data values for **primary are all valid(NOT NULL)**.
  - **Regerential Integrity Rule/Constraint**: if there. is a foreign key in one relation, either each foreign key value must match a primary key value in another relation or the foreign key value must be NULL.
    - Mandatory relationship: foreign. key can not be NULL
    - Optional: foreign. key can be NULL

## Conversion fron ERD to Table Design

### (Strong) Entity Type Rule

this rule use first

- entity type -- table
- entity. Attributes -- table attributes
- identifier -- primary key

### 1-M Relationship Rule

- **1-M relationship** becomes **a foreign key** in the table corresponding to the child entity type.
- This is to include the **primary key** of the table on the **one-side** of the relationship as a **foreign key** in the table on the **many-side** of the relationship.

### M-M Relationship Rule

- Each **M-N relationshop** beacomes **a new table** with **a combined primary key** consisting of the **primary keys of the two participating entity types.**
- The **primary key** of each participating entity type beacomes a **foreign key in the new table**

### Identification Dependency Rule

- The primary key of the table corresponding to the associative(weak) entity consists of :
  - The underlined local key (if any) in the weak entity 
  - the primary keys of the entity types connected by identifying relationship
- The primary keys for the participating entity types are included as **foreign keys of the associative table**

### Weak Entity Type Rule

- For each **weak entity type**, create **a new table** and include all of the attributes as attributes of this relation(weak entity -- table)
- The **primary key** of the new table is the **combination** of the **primary key of the owner** and the **partial identifier of the waeak entity type** if any.(primary key + (partial identifier) -- primary key)
- Then include the **primary key of the strong entity type** it depends on as **a foreign key** in this new table(primary key -- foreign key)

### Optional 1-M Relationship Rule

- Each such optional 1-M relationship can be **converted into a table instead of a foreign key** (optional 1-M relationship --- table)

- The **primary key of the new table** is the **primary key** of the entity type on the **many-side** of the relationship.(**primary key on the M-side --> primary key**)

- The new table contains **foreign keys** for the **primary keys** of the both entity types participating in the relationship (**primary keys --> foreign keys**)

- Both foreign keys in the new table do not permit **NULL** values.

  - **Avoid NULL values in foreign keys, result in more tables, query execution can be slower.** 

    The choice of using this rule in place of 1-M relationship rule **depends on the importance of avoiding null values versus avoiding extra tables.** In many databases, avoiding extra tables may be more important than avoiding null values.

### 1-1 Relationship Rule

- â€“1-1 relationships can be viewed as a special case of 1-M relationships, i.e., **the 1-1 relationship is converted into a foreign key.** 
- **Two tables are created for two entity types.**
- The primary key of one of the tables is included as a foreign key in the other table.
- If the relationship is **optional** with respect to one of the entity types, **include the foreign key in the table on the optional side (to eliminate NULL values).**
